Program, that solves easy sudoku puzzles;
It relies on AC-3 algorithm, and only solves sudokus, if the domain of a cell
can be shrunk down to one;
Maybe later i will revisit this program and i'll add functionality to solve harder
puzzles

UPDATE 18.7.21: SOLVES ALL PUZZLES; theme of CSP resolvers captured my mind for a little while, and
I decided to finish this program by introducing backtracking depth-first seach, as
the chpter in the book suggested; also, I used MRV heuristic in that search, and it runs
pretty good; Also, as a bonus I added functionality for creating sudoku puzzles;
the algorithm is pretty stupid, so it freezes sometimes, especially on easy puzzles;



-s filename                            --- to solve puzzle from filename
-c [easy medium hard expert]           --- to create one
--no options--                         --- read puzzle from standart input and solve it


convert.awk - converts created puzzles from normal output to '0 is empty'


./sudoku -c | ./convert.awk | ./sudoku --- creates and solves a puzzle
